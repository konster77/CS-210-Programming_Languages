# CS-210-Programming_Languages- Christopher Kon

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The Corner Grocer required a program to track items by analyzing the text records generated throughout their business day. The goal was to determine the frequency of purchases to help optimize the store's layout. I developed this program using C++. It reads data from a file, processes and organizes it, communicates within the program, and then outputs the results.

What did you do particularly well?
One of my key strengths in this project was the organization of my code, ensuring it was both readable and easy to follow. Additionally, I provided thorough documentation that detailed each function used, along with an explanation of their implementation.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To improve the code further, I would consider adding more customization options to the output, such as incorporating a store logo or image. Additionally, implementing a feature to assign prices to items and calculate a total for selected items would increase the program's utility.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I encountered challenges with certain functions, particularly those that generated a histogram to display item frequency and those that saved the frequency data to a backup file. I overcame these issues through trial and error, as well as addressing syntax errors that arose during the process.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project reinforced the importance of functional code, which is a valuable asset for any programmer. The ability to develop and refine functions that can be reused or adapted for different programs is a crucial skill that I have further developed. I also gained a deeper understanding of loops and improved my organizational skills.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I followed clean code principles, ensuring that my code was easy to read, understand, maintain, and test. I practiced good programming habits, such as regularly saving my work to prevent data loss. The code was made readable by organizing it logically and including brief comments for clarity. Finally, the program was designed to be adaptable, serving as a foundation for further development into a more complex and commercially viable application.
